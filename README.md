Intel chip's challenge
The Intel Chip's Challenge is an exciting contest that delves into the fascinating world of object detection and machine learning.
Participants are tasked with training a model to accurately identify and classify various objects, such as dogs, people, and cars, within
images. This cutting-edge technology has numerous real-world applications, including surveillance systems, autonomous vehicles, 
and even assistance for visually impaired individuals.

To successfully tackle this challenge, participants need to employ sophisticated neural networks, leveraging the power of deep learning
algorithms. By feeding the model with a diverse range of images and meticulously labeled data, it becomes adept at recognizing the
distinguishing features of different objects. This allows the model to precisely delineate the detected objects in a bounding box,
accompanied by an impressive confidence score of 1.00.

A confidence score of 1.00 signifies that the model has achieved an astounding 100% accuracy in its predictions.
This means that the model has learned the intricate nuances of object detection and can confidently identify dogs,
people, and cars in any given image. This remarkable feat showcases the tremendous potential of machine learning in
revolutionizing various industries, from improving safety on roads to aiding in search and rescue missions.

Participants in the Intel Chip's Challenge have demonstrated their prowess in this complex field, harnessing the power
of state-of-the-art technologies and algorithms. Their ability to harness the immense potential of machine learning 
to tackle such a task is truly commendable. It highlights the incredible advancements made in object detection, paving
the way for a future where intelligent systems seamlessly interact with the physical world around us.

i am completely new to object detection and machine learning.
since i have no idea how this contest works and how it is evaluated.
i have tried my best to complete the contest(ie detect dog,car and people)
